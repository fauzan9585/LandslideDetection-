# LandslideDetection-
Repo for landslide detection using Google Earth Engine
This study is an assignment of internship at Arizona State University
This study compared the performance of machine learning (Random Forest) and rule-based landslide mapping using Google Earth Engine in the Eastern Iburi, Japan
For comparison, the result of mapping could be compared with the field survey landslide inventories, collected by Zhang (2019) (https://zenodo.org/record/2577274#.YSzUrY4zZPY)
